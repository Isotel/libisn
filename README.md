ISN Protocols C Library for use in Embedded Systems for rapid development of ARM and other
micro-controllers assisted with free and cross-platform Isotel IDM Software
(http://isotel.eu/idm) features:

- real-time development and debugging support, especially targetting electronics and control
  applications in which systems cannot be just stopped and stepped thru line by line,
- immediate deployment and integration into python, web, and other test frameworks, and IoT
- use of pytests to make a better (reliable) hardware
- very small footprint and cpu load on micro-controller side while supporting full I/O in various ways
  either as fully transparent I/O that translates to tcp/ip sockets, or higher-level message layer, that
  nicely translates to json with full graphical user-interface support and plotting support
- MCU: send and receive C structures, annotated to represent real values with units and optional accuracy,
- form complex presentations thru cross-reference variables, tables, headings, sections, supporting
  integer, floating point, little and big endian, and arbitrary length bit-sizes formats.
